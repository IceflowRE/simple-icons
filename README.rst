----

Iceflower Simple Icons are monochrome icons with an enhanced visibility.

I provide colored and white style directions.

Preview
=======

You can find a preview of all icons `here <https://github.com/IceflowRE/simple-icons/tree/preview#readme>`__.

Download
========

Every icon package comes as an optimized and minimized version. Both are optimized svg's, to minimize the file size.
Additionally, the optimized version contains the copyright notice.

Reminder: do not forget the attribution wherever you are using the icons.

Download the latest icons `here <https://github.com/IceflowRE/simple-icons/releases/tag/latest>`__.

Design Principles
=================

Every icon

- should be easily distinguishable and visible
- should have a little space to the outer circle
- may have rounded corner to show interactability
- may have a squared / angular corner to show no interactability
- has one arbitrary color which should be the same for every topic
